# Comparing DQN, Dueling Double DQN and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient applied to Robocup Soccer Simulation 2D

This work is designed to help RoboCIn team.
Inside you'll find codes comparing each technique.

For 3000 test episodes:

100k training dqn -> 28% defenses against Helios2013

100k training ddqn -> 67.5% defenses against Helios2013

100k training ddpg -> 37.4% defenses against Helios2013
