The Simulation Soccer 2D League of RoboCup is one of the most matures leagues of the competition having started in 1996. One of the tasks of the intelligent agents is the defense line. It consists of knowing the timing to intercept the ball or do a clever mark (blocking future shoots or passes). A bad timing will lead to an attacker's dribble or pass and probably a goal. Supervised Learning and deterministic algorithms are the usual techniques used by the TOP 5 teams to solve that problem. Recent researches using Deep Reinforcement Learning to train autonomous agents in multi-agent systems have shown that it outperforms agents based on supervised or deterministic algorithms. The team CYRUS2019 has released defensive players trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning achieving in third place on RoboCup2019. This work compares three DRL techniques for defensive agents based on CYRUS2019 adapting the Half Field Offensive environment to an OpenAI GYM like environment and apply the best technique on RoboCIn2d's agents.
