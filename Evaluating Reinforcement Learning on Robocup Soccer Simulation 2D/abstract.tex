The Simulation 2D Football league of RoboCup is one of the most matures leagues of the competition having started in 1996. Supervised Learning and deterministic algorithms are the usual techniques used by the TOP 5 teams. Recent researches using Deep Reinforcement Learning to train autonomous agents in multi-agent systems have shown that it outperforms agents based on supervised or deterministic algorithms. The team CYRUS2019 has released defensive players trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning achieving in third place on RoboCup2019. This work intents to compare three DRL techniques for defensive agents based on CYRUS2019 adapting the Half Field Offensive environment to an OpenAI GYM like environment and apply the best technique on RoboCIn2d's agents.
